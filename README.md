<h2> Description</h2>
This was my first project after finishing Le Wagon's bootcamp. 
It is a fictional page for thematic tours in Iceland and it was created to practice HTML, CSS and SASS.
Even though people say using float to create the layout is kinda old, I decided to create the page using just floats to get familiar with the way it works.
